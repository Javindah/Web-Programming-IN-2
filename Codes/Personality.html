                    <h1> My strongest trait and emotions, hobby and how it impacts my academic life </h1>

                    <h1> Trait </h1>

                    <p> My strongest trait is my determination. In life, we learn more from our failures than from our
                        successes.
                        Success wouldn't be rewarding if we weren't able to fail.
                        Having a strong determination has allowed me to continuously stand up each time I fail.
                        The true meaning of failure is giving up.

                        <br><br>
                        Og Mandino once said <q> Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong
                            enough. </q>
                    </p>


                    <h3> Sadness </h3>
                    <p>
                        When I am sad, I tend to reflect on life and the decisions I have made. This allows me to start
                        over with all the knowledge I have gained.
                    </p>

                    <h3> Hobby </h3>
                    <p>

                        My hobbies are reading, going to the gym, travelling, and watching anime.
                        <br><br>

                        <u> Reading </u>
                        <br><br>

                        <br><br>
                        Reading stimulates the brain, reduces stress, increases relaxation, increases knowledge, and
                        fosters critical thinking.
                        <br><br>

                        <u> Gym </u>
                        <br><br>
                        The gym is therapeutic; it increases my self-confidence and reduces stress.
                        <br><br>


                        <u> Watching Anime </u>
                        <br><br>
                        Anime teaches that determination without consistency, a goal, and a plan is not effective.

                        <br>
                        Kobe Bryant was a determined and consistent individual; he taught me that talent without
                        hard work doesn't guarantee success,
                        and failure is an opportunity to learn. He also trained while no one was watching.

                        Reflection:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The test has validity in general; however, I am in disagreement with some of the individual
                        cases.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Sectarian</h2>
                        <br>
                        Sectarians lack the ability to change, and without change, there will be no growth, whether
                        individually or collectively as a group.
                        The test also states that I am offbeat; an offbeat individual welcomes changes.
                        From my understanding, I do not think someone can be sectarian and offbeat.
