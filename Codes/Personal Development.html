                        I have learned that while setting your main goal, you create micro-goals that will help you accomplish objectives 
                        and contribute to your main goals. Without discipline, it can take you longer to accomplish your goals, 
                        and discipline requires consistency. The more disciplined you are, the more consistent and efficient you will become. 
                        Our friends also have a large impact on our lives, whether directly or indirectly.
                        Therefore, we have to separate our friend group into three sections, which are disassociated, inter-associate, and associate, 
                        or into two sections, which are disassociated and associate. Being able to identify which area to place our friends 
                        in can help us achieve more goals in life and also create a dependable network. Reading books is also very important;
                        they contain a vast amount of knowledge that is beneficial to life and growth. Goals, discipline, 
                        associates, and self-education are just some of the key factors for success and development.
